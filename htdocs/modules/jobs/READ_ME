Things you MUST do before using this module

Before using this module there are some things you NEED TO DO FIRST.

1. You MUST go to JOBS PREFERENCES FIRST and set it up the way you want to. Once you set it to use a Company or not, and add listings, you can not change it later, or it will mess up the way the module works.
2. Then you need to go to JOBS ADMIN and set up categories, permissions, regions, type management. 

IMPORTANT!!!  You must create a category in resumes before trying to set permissions.
IMPORTANT!!!  You must create states or regions unless you don't use states in the preferences.



Donations will allow this software to continue, without them probably not.
